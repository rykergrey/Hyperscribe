[33mc9d8a57[m[33m ([m[1;36mHEAD[m[33m -> [m[1;32mmaster[m[33m)[m Removed: Previous and Next track buttons from the AudioPlayer component.
[33m044cfa5[m Overhaul audio player for enhanced text-to-speech functionality  - Implement playlist feature for sequential or random playback of multiple generated audio files - Add playlist controls including shuffle and repeat options - Introduce ability to generate speech from selected text - Streamline UI with compact buttons for different speech generation sources (Summary, Sandbox, Q&A, Selection) - Improve overall user experience with more intuitive audio controls and visual feedback
[33me820aa2[m I added a video content analyzer function to the Sandbox (handy for parents). added some additional relevant information regarding the video and the channel to the top of the imported transcript.
[33me2fa74d[m I updated the audio player to look better, as well as the sandbox cue feature, which should also function correctly now. Oh, and I also made it so the YouTube video information is included in the raw data import. Oh, and you can now expand all the panels for each of the components. I did that at some point and I don't remember if I made a note, but whatever. Also you can minimize them so you can shrink them down in case you don't want to have to scroll past it to look at a different component. Also, as always, lots of additional tweaks to sandbox functions.
[33me4eb0bd[m Updated the Ask Batman function.
[33mf8203ee[m I added a new sandbox queue function that will let you queue up two sandbox functions to be performed one after the other, automatically. This further enables sandbox function combos. I also added text-to-speech in the sandbox module, as well as a number of experimental new functions, including up-to-date online search capability using Perplexity.
[33mb700aae[m I integrated Elevenlabs streaming text-to-speech functionality to the summary component.
[33m9878f64[m I've fixed the corners of the four main components being all pointy and dumb. I also added a minimize button to each component next to a full screen button and a copy button and I made them icons instead of text buttons.
[33m874803d[m Updated the YouTube comments retrieval function to return 200 comments.
[33m4a80405[m Updated the Readme, added YouTube comments retrieval as a data source, and updated sandbox functions.
[33m56a53a5[m Update README.md
[33m64d243b[m I added copy buttons to all the components. I updated the markdown rendering for the summary in the Q&A boxes.
[33m5f324b8[m For now, I'm hiding the audio transcription file upload field as well as the transcribe audio button, but I haven't touched the actual functions. I also hid the session saving because it's not currently working. And the sandbox functions are not editable at the moment, but they're just hidden as well.
[33m17d9ada[m Updated the functions and disabled function management for the time being.
